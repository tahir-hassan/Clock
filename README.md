## Setting an Icon

I am setting the icon of the application in two places:

* When you go into the project's properties, on the "Application"  tab, there is a section to choose an icon for the application.
* When you go into the Form's properties, there is an "Icon" property you can then set (you select the `.ico` file you want displayed).
